### Creating a Connection Pool

#### From a `clojure.java.jdbc` spec

You can create a C3P0 connection pool with any `clojure.java.jdbc` connection spec map with `:subname` and
`:subprotocol` keys. `connection-pool-spec` will return a `clojure.java.jdbc` connection spec you can use directly:

```clj
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc]
         '[metabase.connection-pool :as connection-pool])

;;; Create a C3P0 connection pool

(let [pool-spec (connection-pool/connection-pool-spec my-jdbc-spec)]
  (jdbc/query pool-spec ["SELECT *"]))
  ```

(You will almost certainly want to store your pool somewhere, such as in an atom).

#### From a JDBC URL String:

You can create a pooled `DataSource` (e.g., for use with [`next-jdbc`](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc)) by calling `pooled-data-source-from-url`:

```clj
(require '[next.jdbc :as jdbc]
         '[metabase.connection-pool :as connection-pool])

(with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection (connection-pool/pooled-data-source-from-url "jdbc:postgres:cam@localhost:3000/my_db"))]
  (reduce my-fn init-value (jdbc/plan connection ["SELECT *"])))
```

### Configuring the connection pool

You can set connection pool options such as size in a `c3p0.properties` file, or by passing them as a map to `connection-pool-spec`:

```clj
(def ^:private connection-pool-properties
  {"maxIdleTime"     (* 3 60 60)
   "minPoolSize"     1
   "initialPoolSize" 1
   "maxPoolSize"     15})

(def my-pool-spec
  (connection-pool/connection-pool-spec my-jdbc-spec connection-pool-properties))
```

See [https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuration_properties](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuration_properties) for a list of all options.

### Destroying connection pools

`destroy-connection-pool!` will destroy the connection pool you created:

```clj
(connection-pool/destroy-connection-pool! pool-spec)
```
